Hey r/linux / r/unixporn!

I've been working on a project to bridge the gap between bleeding-edge Wayland tiling window managers and enterprise-grade system stability: **IRAM OS**.

Traditionally, if you want to run Hyprland with fluid animations and modern tiling, you're pushed toward rolling-release distros like Arch or NixOS, which require constant maintenance and can break with proprietary drivers or enterprise workloads. If you try to compile Hyprland manually, you often end up in dependency and portal hell.

**IRAM OS** solves this by providing a complete, bootable Linux operating system distribution:

### ✨ What’s Inside:
* **True Standalone OS**: Ships as a hybrid **UEFI/BIOS bootable Live ISO** (`iram-os-*.iso`) built using an automated in-house compiler.
* **Intelligent Multi-Display**: Automatically prevents monitor overlapping at `0x0` coordinates and includes a native GUI monitor manager (`iram-displays-gui`).
* **Studio-Grade PipeWire Audio**: Instant sink toggling (`Super + Shift + A`) with ALSA stereo fallback to prevent HDMI TV converter stalls.
* **Persistent Daemon Architecture**: Status bar (`Waybar`) and wallpaper engine (`Swaybg`) run as managed `systemd` user units with monitor readiness polling loops (no fragile terminal scripts).
* **22-Theme Live Sync Engine**: Switch between Tokyo Night, Catppuccin Mocha, Nord, Gruvbox, Everforest, and 17 others instantly with `Super + Ctrl + Shift + Space` — re-tints Hyprland borders, Waybar pills, Wofi launcher, and Alacritty terminal with 0 restarts.
* **Turnkey Live Environment**: Direct autologin into the live Hyprland session with passwordless sudo (`iram:iram`) and installer to disk.

### 📦 Download & Source Code:
* **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/apravint/iram-os
* **Latest ISO Download**: https://github.com/apravint/iram-os/releases/tag/v26.04.0
* **One-line Upgrade for existing Linux users**:
  `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apravint/iram-os/main/install.sh | bash`

I would love to get your feedback, bug reports, and hardware compatibility test results!

### 📌 Title:
> **Show HN: IRAM OS — Turnkey agentic Hyprland desktop OS**

### 📝 Body:

Hi Hacker News,

I built IRAM OS, a standalone Linux distribution that brings the fluid dynamics of the Hyprland Wayland compositor to a rock-solid, production-grade Linux foundation with an integrated autonomous AI toolchain.

GitHub: https://github.com/apravint/iram-os
Latest ISO & Release: https://github.com/apravint/iram-os/releases/tag/v26.04.0

Why I built it:
Many developers love the keyboard-driven ergonomics, workspace grouping, and fluid animations of Hyprland, but don't want the rolling-release friction of Arch or NixOS for their daily driver workstations (especially when using Docker, CUDA, proprietary VPNs, or enterprise toolchains). Meanwhile, traditional desktop environments can feel heavy and lack dynamic tiling.

IRAM OS provides:
- A hybrid UEFI/BIOS bootable Live ISO image with direct hardware installer
- Automated dual-display coordinate allocation preventing geometry collisions
- Managed systemd user services for Waybar and Swaybg with hardware readiness checks
- Dynamic PipeWire audio routing with instant keyboard sink toggles
- A 22-theme palette synchronization subsystem that updates window borders, bar modules, terminal colors, and menus simultaneously without restarting the compositor

You can test it directly by booting the Live ISO from a USB drive or converting an existing Linux system via the included install script.

Feedback and contributions are warmly welcome!
